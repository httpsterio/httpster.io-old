## About

Statistics: 184cm tall, fat as fuck and nearing 30 years old. I have a fiancée with whom I do loads of fun projects with. Personally, I'm alright when it comes to UX design and research, visual design and I can get websites to work as well when I bang my head enough into a wall.

I'm  _m u l t i r a c i a l_  so I'm morally and legally obligated to provide hot takes on current political issues.

I'm also shite at but enjoy the following things - drinking speciality coffee, running Linux and pen DevOps tings and music production. Basically I'm a one-man marketing agency.

## Now

I'm currently fighting Kela to make it possible to use my studies as a rehabilitation measure, so that I don't have to stress about having no steady income. My health has been on a steady decline for a longer time now, but the past half year has been pretty hard on my mental and physical well-being so I'm kind of in a need of a break. I'm waiting for a CPAP-machine as I might have a low-grade sleep apnea. A small cyst or tumor was also found in my pituitary, so that's exciting.

I've finished 31 ECTS credits worth of lectures and courses with an average grade of 4.4/5 for my bachelor's degree in information systems.

My podcast, Rautalanka (Wireframe in english), is also taking shape. I'm gearing up and I've booked a few guests already. Just waiting on my microphone stand so I can actually start recording.
