## About

Statistics: 184cm tall, fat as fuck and nearing 30 years old. I have a fiancée with whom I do loads of fun projects with. Personally, I'm alright when it comes to UX design and research, visual design and I can get websites to work as well when I bang my head enough into a wall.

I'm  _m u l t i r a c i a l_  so I'm morally and legally obligated to provide hot takes on current political issues.

I'm also shite at but enjoy the following things - drinking speciality coffee, running Linux and pen DevOps tings and music production. Basically I'm a one-man marketing agency.

## Now

Physical and mental health went down the shitter at the end of 2019 so I quit my job and started university in 2020. I'd go back if I could, but alas. I've finished approx 23 ECTS credits thus far and I'm starting a Full Stack course at Helsinki's University. I'm currently working on my debut EP / album and trying to start up my music label project as soon as I get the time. I've just learned a bit of C# and made my first MonoGame based project on it. I've also just finished beta testing an application for Adobe.
