## About

Statistics: I'm alright when it comes to UX design and research, visual design and I can get websites to work as well when I bang my head enough into a wall.

I'm also shite at but enjoy the following things - drinking speciality coffee, running Linux and pen DevOps tings and music production. Basically I'm a one-man marketing agency.

## Now

Coding, working, gaming and studying in Uni in a nutshell :)
