I've been growingly frustrated with Hacker News lately. Either my reading into things have changed or people seem to bicker more.

The fast few threads I've taken a part in, users have been fighting about UX, painting their opinions as universal truths. Oh, and apparently 70WPM makes you an expert typist and warrants a "tutorial" post. People these days, I tell you.
