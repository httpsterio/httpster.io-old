I can in earnest say that Tuomas Enbuske is a misogynistic asshole. My Twitter notifications have exploded during the past 24 hours after criticising his rather sad view of how money and wealth are the only attractive features a male can have in the eyes of a female. Likewise, only facial symmetry matters for males. The cherry on top of the cake is that apparently only the poor have substance abuse issues.

There's a lot of hateful rhetoric thrown around social media platforms that rarely gets challenged. I've tried to do my part in both opening up a dialogue or simply criticising and trying to dissect what I consider abusive views. 

I guess we're not in any unique situation if we look back in history, but to me, it feels like the past decade has only been worse when it comes to equality and public discourse in general. It saddens me and fills me with apathy and general distrust in the future.
