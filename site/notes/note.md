Sat Sri Akaal! This is me testing this note system. I might start syndicating these to Twitter in lieu of posting there directly. #BLM is happening at the moment in the world and I'm losing faith (implying I haven't already, hah) in the great big social media platforms.

I'm not a fan of censorship and I vehemently support freedom of speech, but I do think that social media platforms have an obligation to the common good to apply their own personal moral compas and moderate the allowed content based on those. There is no freedom of speech when you're using some company's product and so it should be.

Long story short, Jack and Mark should give the boot to Trump.
